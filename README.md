# Quantitative-Finance: Momentum Backtest

## Introduction
Momentum Portfolio Backtesting is a process used to evaluate the effectiveness of investment strategies that rely on the momentum factor. The momentum factor is based on the idea that assets that have performed well in the recent past are likely to continue to perform well in the future, while assets that have performed poorly are likely to continue to underperform.

### Momentum Factor
The momentum factor is a market anomaly that suggests that assets that have performed well in the recent past are likely to continue to perform well in the future. This factor is based on the idea that investors tend to react slowly to new information, resulting in a delay in the market's response to changes in asset prices.

### Momentum Portfolio
A momentum portfolio is a portfolio of assets that have exhibited strong momentum over a given time period. These portfolios are constructed by selecting assets that have demonstrated strong price performance over the past several months or years.

### Backtesting Methodology
Backtesting is the process of testing a trading strategy using historical data to evaluate its effectiveness. In this section, we will discuss the methodology used in backtesting the momentum portfolio, including the calculation of portfolio returns and risk metrics.
